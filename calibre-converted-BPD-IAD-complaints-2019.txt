1/5/2019 I feel as though this officer is abusing her power and feels she is above the law. I simply tooted my horn at this officer who sat idle at a green light for more than 30 seconds and she seemed to have an attitude about this. During the morning of January 5, 2019 at approx. 1:15AM I pulled out of my parking space and behind the officer's police cruiser. A couple minutes later the light turned green and the officer sat idle at the light for about 30

seconds at which time I noticed she had her head down. I gave my horn a gentle beep and the officer still did not proceed instead she pulled her cruiser to the side and rolled her window down. I pulled alongside the officer to ask if it was ok to proceed around her and through the light. She replied, "What are you in a rush or something?" I told her, "No I'm not in a rush it's late and I'm tired and trying to get home." After which she replied,

"You shouldn't be blowing at a P.O.." I rolled my window back up and proceeded at which time the officer pulled behind me and through the light as well and I went home and she went on about her business. A few days later I received a citation in the mail for "Harsh / objectionable noise (horn)" for no other reason than not fearing this officer and I dared to use my horn to alert her as I would any other driver. If I had truly done anything wrong this officer had the opportunity to issue me a ticket then and should have done so. At no point in time did her flashing lights come on to indicate that she had to respond to a call or emergency. This officer issued this citation out of malice and this is a clear indication of abusing the power she has been given. Because of this officer I have to spend money to dispute this citation and take time out of my day if necessary to appear in court. This officer clearly believes she is above the law and who knows what else she has done and to how many other people who have not spoken up. This shows this officer's character and something needs to be done.

1/12/2019 First and foremost I was at fault for going down a one way on 333 Washington street . My Ticket Number is T1176250 and I intend to pay the full amount. I am an out of state driver , unfamiliar with the streets of Boston. I made the mistake of taking a turn onto 333 Washington street. There were several people in front of me who made the same mistake. I am not writing this to dispute this ticket. However this offer who pulled me over yelled at me , instead of talking to me like a human being. I understood the first time , before I could even show him my navigation system . He starts barking orders with no regard of respect , not allowing me to explain . Mind you , I have had only 1 speeding ticket all my life. I pride on being a safe , responsible and a defensive driver. This officer treated me in which i thought Boston Police Department are not trained to be such uncourteous , un professional , lack of respect and treating people with such disrespect over such a minor situation. The officer would not let me speak or explain , spoke over me in a loud and disrespectful manner. It almost felt like I was dealing with a Bully and a Thug! . I wish I had recorded the incident , so i could show the proof. But I did not want to be one of those individual who , was being uncooperative or disrespecting the officer . There were 3

people in front of me who made the same mistake. I have nothing but respect for the good work Boston Police is known for. Its a shame that I have had such an encounter with such an officer ( 10556). I am sure this complaint will mean nothing and will not be heard by anyone. But My opinion about the Boston Police Department will not change, for all the great work that is done to keep the city safe.

1/15/2019 I was driving on North Washington Street at the intersection of Causeway towards Charlestown/Route 99. there was a green light. There was construction. I was driving through the intersection, and a Boston P.O. stepped into the street from the right immediately to the right of my vehicle putting up his hand to stop but I couldn't stop quickly enough and was in the middle of the intersection, did not have enough space. I stopped as quickly as I could, he chased my vehicle and began banging on the side of the minivan. I opened the window of my car and he started yelling at me. He was using the F word. I was trying to explain why I couldn't stop but he would not listen or stop yelling. He kept yelling, He said "You f*cking ass*, I told you to stop and you didn't stop you a**hole. You f_cking people." He kept repeating these words. He said "you f*cking people" more than once. It was abusive and sounded racist. The driver behind me got out of his car, a man about 50 years old, white, with a hat on, and tried to talk to the officer. He asked the officer what I did wrong but the officer ignored him. This man said that I did not have enough time to stop and that he had almost rear ended my car because I stopped so quickly. the officer did not respond to him. After this man appeared, the office stopped yelling at me, and said "get your f*cking a** out of here."

1/24/2019 I slowed down at a stop sign and did not come to a full stop. It was at the first stop sign on Amory St after turning off of Columbus Ave. An officer immediately flashed his lights and siren, so I pulled over. The officer did not ask for my license and registration, and immediately asked three questions in an aggressive tone:

Do you know the difference between stop and slow down? I responded, "Yes, I'm sorry."

Did you know that was a stop sign? I responded, "Yes officer."

If I took out my baton and started beating you with it, would you stop or slow down? I quietly said "Stop." Officer gave a verbal warning and said, "You have a good night now." I drove home.

The gun was located by Court officer S. Davis (#1084) during routine cell inspections, wedged between the wall and a raining next to the toilet. Court Officer Davis notified his partner J. Davis (#1176) who in turn notified Chief Court Officer Frank Barbour. Officer Davis notified BPD Sgt Short who notified C‐11 Detectives.

1/30/2019 1. McMcormck forced his way into my home without a warrant or ANY legal basis whatsoever and pointed his gun at my family, simply because he was looking for his son (who was not there) On top of this, McMcormick was not even sure of the address, he simply went around into my neighbors'

house, abuses his authority constantly. This occurred in Cambridge, MA. 2 McMormick has threated to "beat my brains out" and was close to arresting me without legal basis simply because he did not like me being with his son. 3. Kelley is a verbally and physically abusive father to his teenage son, he often grabs him by the neck and pushes him against the wall until his wife calms him down. 4. He is an avid racist and homophic, and is discriminatory to his own son who is gay. He has the "n word", the full word, on multiple occasions towards african americans. He will often use sirens and lights on his police car in order to get places faster. These are just the incidents that I am aware of, but I personally believe that Kelley McMcormick is far too biased, quicktempered, irra onal, and naive to be captain of East Boston

While McCormick was noticeable intoxicated, he threated to punch me (I am a 15 year old girl) along with arrest me and my mother without probable cause. He had been out drinking and was noticeably drunk when he attemped to arrest me and my mother without any probably cause IAD2019-0039 Citizen complaint

Officer Frias stated two men entered HQ and turned in a found wallet. She took the wallet to a computer at the front desk to search for the owner on Facebook and if needed, complete an incident report. At that time, Officer Stewart approached her, yelled at her "We don't fucking do that here!" several times. Officer Frias stated Officer Stewart was standing very close to her and pointed his finger at her, while yelling profanities at her. At one point, Officer Stewart told the men to take the wallet back. He then made a phone call and she overheard him talk about the incident and how he couldn't believe what she had done because now people would find out that they could come into HQ for similar purposes.

Officer Frias stated this is the second time Officer Stewart treated her disrespectfully. The other incident occurred approximately 3 months ago on a weekday, toward the end of the day shift, near the metal detector. It involved a man who wanted to report a kidnapping. Officer Stewart allegedly refused to assist the man until he passed through the metal detector and an argument ensued. When Officer Frias tried to intervene, Officer Stewart accused her of "taking sides" and "playing the race card."

Ms. Goss volunteered to take part in a field sobriety test at which point the officer on the passenger side entered her vehicle and told her he was going to conduct a "sobriety drive" test. He directed her to drive and make several turns through the Codman Square area. While on Welles Ave (C‐11), the officer told Ms. Goss to pull over and he exited the vehicle. He then got into the unmarked cruiser that had been following. The following morning, 3/23/19, Ms. Goss realized her wallet was missing. Believing the officer took it from her vehicle, Ms. Goss went to B‐3 to report the incident. Later that day, Ms. Goss received a call from a male who identified himself as the supervisor,

"Officer Byrne", who told her he was present during the incident. Ms. Goss also discussed the incident with Capt. Hosein.

The Officers told Mr. Perry that they knew his son was at that location because they had just pinged his GPS. Mr. Perry insisted that his son was not home and the Officers said that he way lying and that they were not there to "play any fucking games." Mr. Perry felt that this was disrespectful and that his young daughter overheard the conversation.

4/7/2019 I have just been verbally assaulted by one of the Boston P.O.s. He was male, overweight, with beard and mustache, around 50‐55 years old, driving a Boston Police SUV.

He verbally assaulted me by shouting at me, calling me "stupid idiot", "moron" and threatening to arrest me if I didn't "shut up". He also said something like me not respecting Americans, which I didn't quite catch. I am a US citizen but he probably thought I was foreigner. Maybe I don't look sufficiently white to him.

The incident happened after I crossed the pedestrian intersection of SW corridor and Heath St on my bike (from Blue Bikes). I had the right of way for pedestrians, but I interrupted a stream of cars with orange flags on them, which had been crossing the intersection for some time. I thought they were part of a protest, but apparently they were part of a funeral procession.

As soon as I crossed the pedestrian crossing, I heard someone shouting insults at me: "you stupid idiot, moron" etc. I stopped, turned, and saw the policeman, raging from the inside of his car, having pulled his window down. He continued shouting insults at me, which I don't remember. He shouted

"this is a funeral, somebody died!". I tried to tell him that I didn't know it was a funeral, but he wouldn't listen. He continued shouting at me and telling me to "shut up" or he will "arrest me". I tried again to explain to him that I had no idea that this was a funeral, but he continued shouting abuses at me, telling me things about "Americans" which I didn't quite catch. Then he drove away, as he continued shouting at me. I didn't have time to get his car's number or anything else. I believe I would recognize him, however, if I saw him again.

There was a witness to the incident, a lady riding her bike too, who stopped and witnessed the whole thing. Unfortunately I didn't think to take her contact informa on. She did tell me though that she also didn't know this was a funeral. She said she was "American".

I would like to file a complaint against this officer, as his behavior is unacceptable. I am still shaken up, and the rest of my day is ruined. I am an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Northeastern University. I was heading to my office to work on a proposal for the National Science Founda on, due in a few days. Now I'm too shaken up by this incident.

My opinion on the Boston Police Department has taken a strong hit. I have lived in other places in the US, and I thought Boston Police were better.

Unfortunately, I no longer believe that. I cannot believe how you allow a culture of abuse of citizens by P.O.s. This has to stop. We are not dogs to be d lik

2/6/2019 At 12:50am on 2/6/19 I was . There was some incident on the opposite side of the street at the time and on an unlit ambulance was parked in the middle of the direction I was heading in. I proceeded with caution and attempted to go to the right lane to pass the emergency vehicle that did not have it lights on. As I went into the right lane the ambulance abruP.O.y made a u turn with no signal light while cutting me off. I then attempted to evade an accident by moving back to left lane and slammed on the breaks. At this time i was pulled over, An officer in plain clothing with no badge clearly displayed came to the rear drivers side window of my car demanding that each window be lowered and wanted identification. I was compliant and tried to ask this officer what had happened that caused him to pull me over. He then stated, "Give me your fucking License and Registration". He then went on to demand identification for the rear drivers side passenger and threatened him, "If you don't give me your fucking registration I will give you a ticket". He went back to the police vehicle for 10 minutes then came back to the driver side of my car and threw my documentation at me and stormed off with no words. As he did that I was simply trying to talk to the officer to understand what had happened.

I do not understand why this Officer disrespected me the way he did and I would like action taken against him to prevent him from treating others this way.

2/15/2019 The officer pulled a passenger and I over in a heavily trafficked area because he thought I had failed to yield to a pedestrian at a crosswalk at 4:25 pm on February 15th last Friday. This is a high traffic area on a Friday, so you can't go blowing by pedestrians due to traffic. While I noticed the lights come on, I put my emergency lights and tried to move to the side as not to affect the flow of traffic. The officer thought it would be appropriate to shake his head at me as I tried to be courteous to other drivers on the road and also get to a safer location. He then preceded to give me an attitude and shake his head at me further during our interaction, which was all witnessed by my passenger. He also admitted to my passenger and I that the person in front of me committed the infraction and that he should have gone after them, but chose me because I was easier. Now, not only did we not see a pedestrian but the officer puts his judgment of the offense into question because he's not even sure what had happened. Also, the address on my citation is also incorrect and B09 is not my house number. The facts don't line up and for someone to be in a position of enforcement who does not value respect or show conviction in their judgment this does not inspire confidence or trust in the person's assessment capabilities or the system that produced him. I showed the officer the proper respect due to anyone in law enforcement and the least he can do is provide me the same respect in return with conviction in his assessment of the claimed offense. This officer clearly had no courtesy or sound judgment capabilities.

4/10/2019 I was driving on Brighton Ave heading east and I passed by Allston ave and just after I passed the light I was about to make a legal u turn when I noticed a police car was behind my car. To be honest I was not aware at that point I was the one the police was stopping because I felt I hadn't done anything wrong. As result I got confused a li le bit nervous and stop my car.

After stop, one the officer started addressed me with a coercive attitude, that I felt unsafe. I was shock with the officer's lack of professionalism. He accuses me that I fail to stop on red, Honestly, to my best knowledge I thought I didn't pass on red, but he replied jeckerly that he was in green too. I felt belittled and threatened. As result, I was struggling to find my registration. The officer got even impatient and rudely told that he was adding another fine to the cked even a er I found the registra on.

At that point, I turned on my cellphone camera discreetly, and even after I addressing respectfully to clarify that I had my registration, the officer was rude cut me off and did not have the decency to handle the ticked on my hand. Instead he toasted inside my dashboard. I never felt so humiliated in my life. I was so mad that I wanted published in social media the video, but I had friends and family that are law enforcements, and I have good regards for their selfless job.

However, I believe this type of incident should not happen to anyone. I know this officer noticed I was working in Uber, and he should not be so rude without a reason. I honestly felt like he was preying on drivers to fulfill a ticket quora or something, or perhaps had a tough day. Otherwise I don't understand why he was so condescend.

By the way The officer wrote the numbers in a way I could not know whether last digit is 11675, 6 or 8.

While operating on Sumner St Eastbound with lights and sirens activtaed, he attempted to clear space and pass between an MBTA bus operating Westbound, and a motor veicle stopped that was heading Eastbound. Camera footage later revealed that the bus attempted to pull to the right as required by law, but could not due to the presence of another motor vehicle on his right. Officer Geary was assigned as the "rifle car" and was operating a Patrol Supervisor motor vehicle due to the fact that the assigned gun car was in the shop for repairs. At some poiunt as Officer Geary attempted to squeeze by the bus, he came into contact with the side of the bus, causing slight damage to bus and slgiht damage to side of cruiser.

Officer Geary stopped quickly, but then continued to call to assist. After the initial events, Officer Geary failed to report the accident to a supervisor and follow the usual procedures for reporting and documenting a Department motor vehicle accident. Sgt. Harrington was assigned to research the events and was able to ascertain that Officer Geary did in fact come in contact with the bus (bus driver report CC#19202786 and other supplimentals), and was also able to retrieve video from bus cameras. Officer Geary failed to timely report such, going on Dyas off and then Military Days, before being ordered back to work to report. He was advised of his Canrey and Weingartn rights for precaus onary reasons.

Rule 102 Section 4. states 4 NEGLECT OF DUTY: This includes any conduct or omission which is not in accordance with established and ordinary duties or procedures as to such employees or

which cons tutes use of unreasonable judgment in the exercising of any discre on granted to an employee.

The ordinary and proper procedure for officers involved in a motor vehicle accident is to immediately report and document such (Rule 316). Officer Geary neglected to do such, and in doing so, violated Rule 102 Section 4. Upon having conversation with Officer Geary about the circumstances, while nervous and embarassed about the events, he was forthright and accepting of the situation and understood the nature and necessity of the Rules and Regulations. He understands and accepts responsibility for the events and understands and is not resistant to the fact that disciplinary action may be necessary.

Officer Geary failed to timely report such, going on Dyas off and then Military Days, before being ordered back to work to report. He was advised of his Canrey and Weingartn rights for precaus onary reasons.

Rule 102 Section 4. states 4 NEGLECT OF DUTY: This includes any conduct or omission which is not in accordance with established and ordinary duties or procedures as to such employees or

which cons tutes use of unreasonable judgment in the exercising of any discre on granted to an employee.

The ordinary and proper procedure for officers involved in a motor vehicle accident is to immediately report and document such (Rule 316). Officer Geary neglected to do such, and in doing so, violated Rule 102 Section 4. Upon having conversation with Officer Geary about the circumstances, while nervous and embarassed about the events, he was forthright and accepting of the situation and understood the nature and necessity of the Rules and Regulations. He understands and accepts responsibility for the events and understands and is not resistant to the fact that disciplinary action may be necessary.

5/16/2019 As I was walking to the commuter rail station, I noticed a BPD cruiser pulling out from the village market parking lot in the wrong direction. I did not notice any signalling on their part as they reversed in to a parking spot. As I walked by, I stopped and asked if they would pull someone over who did the same thing they did. They said their lights were on, I said I didn't see them and was then told by the passenger that I should buy some sunglasses.

When I asked why they needed to cut through the parkinglot instead of going around (like everyone is supposed to), I was told to mind my own business.

As someone who has 15 years of customer service and working with troubled teens, I'm wondering how your officers are trained to respond to ques ons from the public.

Furthermore, who is assigning traffic duty? BPD is nowhere to be found in Rozzie Village from 8am until 9am, but then they show up at 930 on weekday to police a crosswalk where most folks actually stop and a supermarket exit? That's a waste of resources.

Anyways, I'd love to know about the type of de‐escalation training officers receive as well as training with the general public. When I ask a question of an officer, as a taxpayer and a resident of Boston I expect to be treated with respect by the employees of the city.

11/9/2018 During the week of November 03, 2018 through November 10, 2018, Boston P.O. Curtis Jones, ID #131272, performed 94.75 hours of overtime and detail work bringing him over the 90‐ Hour Rule limit by 4.75 hours, thus putting him in violation of Boston Police Rules and Regulations Rule 102, Sec on 10C, Subsec on (a).



Officer Jones submitted a report stating that he was unaware that overtime hours worked from a forced labor dispute during the week in question were calculated into the weekly total. This caused him to miscalculate his hours and pu ng him over the 90 Hour Rule limit.

On Tuesday, May 14, 2019, District B‐3 Last Half Duty Supervisor Lt. Dean Bickerton spoke with Officer Jones regarding his 90 hour rule violation and explained to Officer Jones that all overtime hours, whether ordered or volunteered for, are calculated towards the weekly 90 hour rule period. Officer Jones acknowledged and accepted Lt. Bickerton's explana on. Lt. Bickerton then administered to Officer Jones an Oral Reprimand.

I respectfully request that no further action be taken in this matter

5/29/2019 I called 911 around approx. 9:30pm to report someone drunk walking staggering in my yard, peeing on the bush near my back porch stairs, slurring and threatening my husband after he confronted the person for doing so. The person left out my yard still threatening my husband telling him to "come do something about it n‐word, I ain't going nowhere. I'll be right here if you want to come do something about it". About ten minutes later the police show up, two officers one was kind of tall with glasses, a slick back ponytail, slim build and the other officer was shorter with a bold head, stocky build. They did not make the guy get out his car, they did not search him, his car was still running with the keys in the ignition and him in the drivers seat, he also had an open container in his car (a red cup). My husband and I both said we want to press charges for the threats and they told us he couldn't be arrested because that wasn't an arrest able offence. The officers, then let this man just drive away (again he was drunk) and they just let him drive away. I believe that my tax paying dollars are being used for nothing, if I call with an complaint of a drunk person peeing outside my house, offer to show video evidence of such action happening, watch as this man slurs over his sentences talking to the police, and then still be able to drive off after not only peeing in my yard where I have children who play but, threaten a member of my family and then have the pleasure to just drive away drunk without any consequences is troubling to me because the policing to me seemed inadequate, insufficient, and lacking the proper training/skills to deal with these types of situations/circumstances appropriately. I demand this matter be looked into more closely and adequately because these types of problems should not be happening with "Boston's Finest" they give the P.O.s who actually do their jobs a bad reputation.

At one point she stated that the white officer pulled her aside into a dark area of the driveway and said, "I want you to say you gave the Repo man permission to take the car." She feels the Officer was doing that in order to make the process go faster. She said she has a video of the encounter and will provide to IAD.

Ms. Whitley feels the officer was very unprofessional and was very uncomfortable about the way the officer was speaking to her. She also stated that she is a Veteran and will be deployed over seas on July 3, 2019 for a month.

6/5/2019 I was illegally towed on Wednesday, June 5th. I was parked on the odd (south) side of the street on Temple Pl, in downtown Boston, where you can park from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m., as I have many times before. My car had been towed before I went outside before 7 a.m. that morning. On the BPD vehicle inventory page, the officer wrote the address for my car as 52 Temple Place, which would be the even (north) side of the street. The entire even (north) side of the street on Temple Place is a No Parking zone, and therefore, I was unable to win the hearing I had with the Parking Clerk to recoup my towing fees and to fight the parking ticket. I do not understand how an officer can put a completely incorrect address for the location of a parked car, especially in this instance, when my car was parked about half way down the street and on the opposite side from where he said it was. The fact that my evidence said 52 Temple Pl. meant I could never win the dispute I had for the towing, which I would have most certainly won had the location of my parked car been accurately reported.

It was Officr King's statement that after a First half on Saturday, June 8th, she left work and went to Jevelli's restaurant at 387 Chelsea St to meet up with co‐workers. She states she has a specific memory of securing her firearm in the glove compartment of her POV and that she had locked the glove compartment. She then entered Jevelli's, leaving at about 2AM. She then proceeded to park her car on Orleans St by the Cunard Tavern, and then stayed the night at a friend's apartment (S. Wilbanks). On Sunday, at about 1130 hours, she returned to her car and realized her firearm was missing. She states that she searched the car as well as the apartment, and was assisted in re‐searching it by Wilbanks and Calderon. When they had no success, they immediately reported to District 7 to advise the Duty Supervisor. I was contacted by Lt. Wilbanks as well and responded to A-7 to begin investigation.

She then proceeded to park her car on Orleans St by the Cunard Tavern, and then stayed the night at a friend's apartment (S. Wilbanks). On Sunday, at about 1130 hours, she returned to her car and realized her firearm was missing. She states that she searched the car as well as the apartment, and was assisted in re‐searching it by Wilbanks and Calderon. When they had no success, they immediately reported to District 7 to advise the Duty Supervisor. I was contacted by Lt. Wilbanks as well and responded to A-7 to begin investigation.

6/8/2019 On the evening of June 8th of 2019, at approximately 8:30PM, there was an incident outside my residence in Dorchester on Glenrose Road.

I was sitting in my kitchen (back of house) when I heard commotion and men yelling outside the front of the house. Upon hearing the noise, I went to my front porch (second level) and looked down to the street to see what was going on. I saw two young African American men (whom I later learned are named Josiah and Joseph) on either side of a car parked in front of the navy blue house across the street from me. Both young men had one or two large (unidentified and out of uniform) officers standing over them and beating them. Both young men were bleeding from their arms and legs. I should note here that all officers seen in this incident were White/ Caucasian presenting. (As soon as I felt as though the situation was unsafe or unjus fied, I began recording on my phone. Video footage is a ached.)

The man on the left side of the car by the curb (Josiah) stated aloud, "I am bleeding from the head profusely" several times. In addition, the young man on the right side (Joseph) yelled repeatedly, "We didn't do anything illegal." The four officers that were present were out of breath (which we later learned was from them chasing them down the block), continuing to hit both men (who were not on the curb). The man dressed in stripes was yelling

"Are you delusional?" towards the suspects (as seen in the video). During this part of the incident, myself and many neighbors were now out on their porches, front steps, and the sidewalk watching this incident/ arrest take place.

Within about two minutes, several other under cover cars (unmarked police vehicles) arrived on the scene and got out of their vehicles. They approached the two African American men, along with the four officers standing over them. The two young men were now hand‐cuffed on the ground, sitting on the curb, still bleeding. At this time, several more young African American men came onto the street, calling out to the two young men in hand cuffs. I inferred that they were friends of the two men, and they began questioning the police about a missing cellphone. The cellphone was not found on either suspect.

After a few minutes of the young man yelling that he was bleeding from his head, I gave my phone to my friend who was present so that she could continue filming, while I went downstairs from the porch with some napkins and wipes to help the young man, as the officers were ignoring him and he was bleeding profusely from the head. I walked outside and asked to give the young man a bandage and I was told that I could not because I was not a medic or nurse. About ten minutes later, the two men were taken away in marked police vehicles, one with a dog inside. The two vehicles pulled off and all the people on the street dispersed.

Hours later, the two young men came back down my street in search of some of their belongings they thought they had lost during the beating and arrest. I was still sitting on the porch and ended up speaking with them for a while. After learning their ages, a little about their own backgrounds, and making sure they were physically ‐ I asked more about what took place. They expressed to me that they had been chased prior to the beating. They also expressed the extremely inappropriate and upsetting treatment while being "booked" in the police station. As I was speaking with them both, they were both s ll bleeding; Josiah had staples put into his scalp with no numbing medica on and Joseph was bleeding from both hands and legs.

6/12/2019 On the Boston streets (near Faneuil Hall), I was seeking to enter into traffic. This car did everything in their power not to let me in (came within inches of hitting each other). I had a chance to pull up next to him and nicely suggested he" let people into traffic and we'd all be better off..." He abruP.O.y threatened to give me a ticket (again, he was in an unmarked car and not wearing any police uniform). Quite honestly, I jabbed back (not so nicely) and said we'd probably collide next me.. "this is a f‐ing rental so I don't care." We both moved on ‐ I gave him a thumbs up sign as I le On busy rt 93 (going toward the airport), I see police lights behind me and this car is aggressively trying to pull me over. It was the same person I spoke with earlier. He took my license ‐ after some time, he came back to my car and told me he was giving me a citation (although he did give me my license back). As he walked away, I asked for what (2X). He got back into his car and drove off.

First, I assume you don't want your undercover police wasting their time like this (not my worry). Second, this poor behavior, elitist actions and idle threats are ridiculous and shouldn't be a part of any police department.

I've moved on ‐ but this person should be instructed on proper behavior and avoid petty threats. Admittedly, it was threatening to be arbitrarily pulled over on a busy highway by an unmarked car and (I guess)an officer not wearing a uniform hi ng me with threats.

Unprofessional and poor behavior (not to men on was ng my me and valuable police me).

6/16/2019 I called about an altercation that was happening on the corner of Greenwood & Roxton street in Dorchester. There was a man beating a woman up in the street. He was also vandalizing her car, and screaming profanities to her. I called the police 3 times as the incident continued to grow. On two occasions the police showed up and went to a house. (my directions were clear that the incident was on the corner) While police were there, they continued arguing but quickly took the argument into the car. After police drove off they got out of the car and this man continued beating and screaming at this woman. I called back a third time, this time very frustrated as the police still had not intervened in a way that was productive. This time, I voiced my frustrations to the dispatcher and explain to her that this man is continually hitting this woman and the police are doing nothing. The dispatchers response is as follows "she's getting beat up in the street and is Letting the police leave?" My response‐ "well I guess so, it's probably a domes c violence situa on"

I say all this to say, that I am deeply disgusted with both the police and the dispatcher. If either had received prior training in Domestic violence they would know that this type of behavior is common in DV relationships. For the dispatcher to make that comment it suggests that it's the woman's fault for getting beat up. It disregards the dynamics of power and control and the psychological effects it can have on a victim. I'm disappointed in the effort the police gave in this situation, I watched as one officer approached the couple, asked some questions and left. Often times than not in my community police flex their muscles in moments where it's unnecessary but when it's about a woman of color being beat in the street the muscles seem to deflate.

The effort was minimal and disgusting. I would like to speak to someone regarding this matter and also suggest domestic violence training for all staff. It is impera ve to understand DV prior to approaching a situa on like this. It is clear that neither the police or dispatcher had prior training on this.

2‐3 Yrs ago in a dispute with a tenant when the officers came to talk to me, one of the officers was so forceful and aggressive as I was telling the Sgt.

that I had a restraining order also the other officer went out to his car saying "I'll find out if you do or not! now I'm in my apt. and this officer was at his car 45 feet away from me and he screamed "shut, the fuck up or I'll arrest you!! The Sgt. was quiet and took my copy. I have been in therapy over 20

Yrs. and one of my illnesses is PTSD and I've relived that moment ever since. Had he had a body worn camera on I wonder if he would have used his position to scare me and feel like no one to protect me from him. C‐11 have made mockeries in their police reports. I have copies of them. When I hear on the news about the body cameras I get sick and shake, I have no faith in C‐11 Police for what I've gone through. Somehow I need to get this out, I'll be reaching out to Andrea Campbell's office for help as a victim of domestic and childhood abuse the actions of that office I will never forget. I'm shaking like a leaf reliving that officer 45 feet from my kitchen doorway that was police brutality to a mentally disabled single woman, I am finally speaking out about that incident it's a healing process. Police shouldn't swear like that at 58 yr old women for no reason.

6/9/2019 About 12:30 PM on July 8, 2019 the complainant, Sherrice Williams, called IIU to initiate a complaint on behalf of her 11 yr old daughter Leeajah Williams (01/21/2008). Mrs. Williams provided that her daughter had been arrested for shoplifting at the Primark Store located at 10 Winter St on June 9, 2019. She commented that her daughter had been subjected to physically abusive behavior by the store's security personnel and the responding BPD officers. The incident is documented in BPD report I # 192043651. The report provides that her daughter was extremely violent and threatening toward store security and BPD officers. The younger Ms. Wiliams was transported to A‐1 but released to her mother's custody so that she could seek medical attention due to her behavior. She was summonsed for one count each of Shoplifting, A&B on a P.O., A&B, Disturbing the Peace, and Resisting Arrest. According to Mrs. Williams the charges were dismissed.

6/25/2019 Officer Sosa entered my home when it was unoccupied at approx 12:22 pm and then later enters my driveway and backyard at approximately 12:40

pm. The interaction with my family began after he initially entered my home. My child and her father (Michael) came home and were greeted by the officer coming out of my front door. Officer Sosa had entered my home without invitation pertaining to damage to his personal vehicle while working a detail for construction occurring on my street. The damage occurred unwitnessed and was noticed by Sosa at approx 12:20, my vehicle left my driveway at approx 10:50 am. The officer assumed it was my vehicle that damaged his and is coaching witnesses (a construction worker and another officer) that he later identified on an insurance claim as physically witnessing the accident. After acting out in detail what he believed happened to these "witnesses", he entered my home through an unlocked completely closed front door, exited my home to greet my family and immediately behaves in an aggressive and irate manner frightening my family. If an officer is willing to enter a private residence over cosmetic damage to his personal vehicle there is no reason to believe that he will act in a just, fair, or reasonable manner. This invoked deep fear in my family. He continued to display irate behavior by yelling and physical behavior, failed to be civil, respectful, courteous, or considerate at any point in time. The actions of the police lacked reasonableness and prudence and ultimately led to extreme distress within my family especially for myself and my children but also for their father. Cosmetic damage to a parked vehicle does not seem to fall under high priority violations, yet the officer insisted that the father of my child was going to be arrested and repeatedly verbally threatened that he would be "locked up". Michael complied with Officer Sosa and retrieved the vehicle's registration and his identification. The officer continues to yell, gesture with his hand, and appear aggressive, impulsive, and confrontational.

Michael's body language is also very clear, with slumping shoulders pleading with the officer to be reasonable and less aggressive in front of my small child to no avail although he was also upset by the situation. Michael then tries to remove himself and my daughter from the situation after giving all information to officer and take her around the block on her scooter. Sosa then calls over the other officer and they pursue Michael to bring him back to 15 Castlerock street, which he complies with. When it is clear that the officer is making good on his threats, Michael ran away out of fear therefore leaving my child unattended. He was then thrown to the ground and sustained multiple lacerations when he was captured and arrested. He refused to speak about the injuries or go into detail. I can only wonder if this is also out of fear. When the unidentified officer reached my daughter when she was alone, he then brought over my neighbor and the unidentified officer, neighbor and my 2 year old daughter all entered my home and apartment for a few moments. I am unsure about the laws there but that is also a violation of my privacy and very unsettling. I was at work during this altercation where I am unable to have my cell phone on my person. When checking my phone on break I saw multiple calls and after a few minutes was able to find out that my daughter was in police custody. I am in the orientation phase as well as probationary phase at this new job and having to leave during my shift is cause for termination; this was unimportant at the time because reaching my daughter was my priority. I experienced a panic attack during the ride to find my daughter, with her location changing while I was en route to her from my home to Carney Hospital. My two year old daughter was being held in the ER alone next to an adult psychiatric patient in crisis that was physically and verbally assaulting staff. The patient had to be h

7/12/2019 On Friday, July 12, 2019, at approximately 15:42 hours, Officer Castera Bazile (ID#10240) was contacted by Sgt. Cottone via department radio to contact the Duty Supervisor. P.O. Bazile failed to acknowledge this directive and did not answer his cellphone despite being on a day tour in District E‐18. Sgt.

Felton, the First Half Patrol Supervisor in District E‐18 then went on the air and raised P.O. Bazile and directed him to contact Sgt. Co one at E‐5.

Upon calling E‐5 and speaking with Sgt. Cottone, P.O. Bazile was informed he was ordered to perform a Last Half tour of Duty in District E‐13 tonight, July 12, 2019. P.O. Bazile stated to Sgt. Cottone, "I respectfully refuse". Sgt. Cottone informed him it was a direct order and that he was to report for the tour. P.O. Bazile again stated that he "refused" the directive and that he was leaving for a trip in the morning. P.O. Bazile stated that he had submitted a personal day for Saturday, 07/13/19. Sgt. Cottone informed P.O. Bazile that such submission does not exempt him from a tour of duty for 07/12/19

and that the "To Be Ordered List" was near exhaustion, thus the directive to report for the last half tour was final. P.O. Bazile plainly stated he would not report for said tour of duty.

Sgt. Cottone confirmed with P.O. Bazile that he was knowingly disobeying a direct order by a Superior Officer, to which he acknowledged. Sgt. Cottone then ordered P.O. Bazile to submit a Form 26 report detailing the conversa on had between them and his reasons for failure to obey a direct order.

P.O. Bazile was ordered to submit the Form 26 before the end of his tour of duty on Friday, July 12, 2019 and to fax it to E‐5 at 3‐5339. P.O. Bazile did not submit the Form 26 as directed and left E‐18 (per Sgt. MacDonald).

Respectful Treatment

Pending

7/13/2019 I do not have the badge numbers or names of the P.O.s, however, I remember most of the license plate number of their squad car. It is B276. After an altercation where the police were called on me in the North End, these two officers came to my location and their behavior towards me was unacceptable. I could tell that they were not adhering to the standards that the Boston Police Department has, thus I called the Boston Police Department to send others because I felt unsafe. No one ended up coming. The two officers told me that they "were going to beat my ass." It got to the point where I had to make space between them and I because I felt as if they were actually going to assault me or unjustly arrest me. Later on that night, I went to the District A‐1 office to file a complaint/police report. I was told that I "had mental health problems" by Officer McCarthy who was manning down the front desk. Officers refused to file a complaint or report on those two officers. I would not leave from the District A‐1 office until I was actually taking seriously, however, they never did. I ended up waiting in the station for 3 and a half hours. The whole time I was at the front desk waiting while it sat vacant for those 3 and a half which I assume is not protocol or the right thing to do. Officer McCarthy also called an ambulance to get me out of the police station as if I was extremely intoxicated. I was not. The ambulance came and they did tests on me then told Officer McCarthy that I was not extremely intoxicated and told him that they could not do anything. I ended up leaving around 7:30 as I did not sleep because I was dealing with this situation. All of this happened last night because the cops were called on me. I was not treated with an ounce of respect and felt extremely unsafe. It is upsetting that I had to call other officers to be witnesses to the original location, although they never came. It is also upsetting that I was inside of the District A‐1 office for three hours and no P.O. would take me seriously. How are you supposed to hold the police accountable if they will not let you? As representatives of the Boston Police Department and the police in general, those two officers actions and all of the idle witnesses (tens of officers who were in the station last night) was unacceptable. I am unable to find my phone at the moment and will be getting a new one soon, so email would probably work best to communicate.

During the confrontation I spoke my mind off and then he left. minutes later he came back raising his boys shouting and being defiant I told him to leave the store one of my crew came over to make sure that thing doesn't get out of hand. while the person and I exchanged words he came and slap me on the right side of my face knocking off my headset for which I used when I work in the cooler. Then after I took it upon myself to call 911, the operator said that she will send someone over. While waiting for the police to come minute after the person was next to government center making threat remarks. I call 911 for the second time and I told the operator I made a previous call and told this is an emergency situation because I was assaulted in a store. On the first call I wait a half‐hour no one showed up. On the second call they showed up within 10 to 12 minutes. Having video evidence of the situation, and my face was completely red off the impact, I told the cops are the situation and it's funny they reply to me saying what do you want us to do bring him here so you can hit him or slap him around and I told the cops no I want you to go search for that guy he made a committed a felony by stealing and then came to the store and hit an employee. later on that afternoon as I went home I ask myself where is the protect and serve for which each cop is sworn, I guess in this case serve and protect didn't apply to me.

While waiting for the police to come minute after the person was next to government center making threat remarks. I call 911 for the second time and I told the operator I made a previous call and told this is an emergency situation because I was assaulted in a store. On the first call I wait a half‐hour no one showed up. On the second call they showed up within 10 to 12 minutes. Having video evidence of the situation, and my face was completely red off the impact, I told the cops are the situation and it's funny they reply to me saying what do you want us to do bring him here so you can hit him or slap him around and I told the cops no I want you to go search for that guy he made a committed a felony by stealing and then came to the store and hit an employee. later on that afternoon as I went home I ask myself where is the protect and serve for which each cop is sworn, I guess in this case serve and protect didn't apply to me.

6/8/2019 At exactly 1:47am on Saturday, June 8th, 2019, I was walking past the 7/11 located next to Faneuil Hall in downtown Boston when I walked past a service vehicle belonging to the Boston Police Department's district A1. Observed in the vehicle at the time were two plain clothed officers one of which was McCarthy, badge #2306 as well as his partner that night who's badge number is unknown at the time. As I was walking by, I, along with many others witnessed the officer pointing his high powered flashlight in the eyes of people walking by his service vehicle. As expected, when I walked by his vehicle he shined his high powered flashlight directly into my eyes, to which I simply asked that he not do so. Taking offense to my asking, officer McCarthy took it upon himself to exit his vehicle, & hurriedly walk up to me even though I was exiting the area & was headed to my vehicle. I was 100%

sober, completely oriented, & causing absolutely no trouble. I was literally heading towards my vehicle to leave the area when badge #2306 caught up to me & detained me in the parking lot. He asked me for my ID which I told him was in a parked car around the corner. When I asked if he wanted to walk with me to retrieve it, the officer said no. When confronted about the reason for detainment, McCarthy said, & I quote, "for running your mouth", as the officer knows, that is not a lawful reason for a stop. I am free to ask him not to shine his flashlight in my eyes for an extended period of time the same way I am free to ask him for the reason for which he decided to detain me for simply passing on a publicly accessible road. The officer became more & more irritated with me asking him for a legitimate reason for his detainment, & my recording of the incident, & then decided to place his hands on the collar of my shirt & shove me back 10 feet with his fist wrapped around the top part of my shirt, telling me that I needed to calm down, when he was actively creating a simple conversation into a violent & physical altercation. I asked him to release my shirt, & told him he did not have the consent to touch me. Yet, feeling even more emboldened by my saying that, he grabbed my collar & shoved me further back until I was pressed up against the hood of his vehicle a few more feet behind me, & still held his grip on my collar. Expecting a reaction out of me, he continued to hold onto my shirt while notifying me that he would arrest me if I did not comply with his unlawful detainment, search, & seizure of myself & my belongings. The officer then asked me for my last name, which I provided, & when I in return asked him once more for the law or penal code I had broken to justify his detainment of me, he wouldn't respond. He then notified me that, he would instead arrest me for disorderly conduct, despite the fact that I was 100% oriented, walking away from the scene before he pursued me for no justified reason, & then decided to charge me with that simply because I had inquired about the status of the illegitimate stop. Officer McCarthy then decided to slam me against the hood of his vehicle while him & his partner arrested me. Upon the arrest McCarthy's partner, came up to me & said & I quote, "We can't have you out here stepping on our backs", which makes no sense seeing as though I was just lawfully passing by, & when detained simply asked for them to cite a lawful penal code or crime I committed that justified their detainment & arrest. This detainment & arrest was simply a power move, it was the officers displaying that they could do what they wanted & know that they would face no consequences whatsoever. Not only was I unlawfully detained, searched, & had my property seized, one of the two videos I have of the incident were deleted off of my phone.

6/8/2019 At exactly 1:47am on Saturday, June 8th, 2019, I was walking past the 7/11 located next to Faneuil Hall in downtown Boston when I walked past a service vehicle belonging to the Boston Police Department's district A1. Observed in the vehicle at the time were two plain clothed officers one of which was McCarthy, badge #2306 as well as his partner that night who's badge number is unknown at the time. As I was walking by, I, along with many others witnessed the officer pointing his high powered flashlight in the eyes of people walking by his service vehicle. As expected, when I walked by his vehicle he shined his high powered flashlight directly into my eyes, to which I simply asked that he not do so. Taking offense to my asking, officer McCarthy took it upon himself to exit his vehicle, & hurriedly walk up to me even though I was exiting the area & was headed to my vehicle. I was 100%

sober, completely oriented, & causing absolutely no trouble. I was literally heading towards my vehicle to leave the area when badge #2306 caught up to me & detained me in the parking lot. He asked me for my ID which I told him was in a parked car around the corner. When I asked if he wanted to walk with me to retrieve it, the officer said no. When confronted about the reason for detainment, McCarthy said, & I quote, "for running your mouth", as the officer knows, that is not a lawful reason for a stop. I am free to ask him not to shine his flashlight in my eyes for an extended period of time the same way I am free to ask him for the reason for which he decided to detain me for simply passing on a publicly accessible road. The officer became more & more irritated with me asking him for a legitimate reason for his detainment, & my recording of the incident, & then decided to place his hands on the collar of my shirt & shove me back 10 feet with his fist wrapped around the top part of my shirt, telling me that I needed to calm down, when he was actively creating a simple conversation into a violent & physical altercation. I asked him to release my shirt, & told him he did not have the consent to touch me. Yet, feeling even more emboldened by my saying that, he grabbed my collar & shoved me further back until I was pressed up against the hood of his vehicle a few more feet behind me, & still held his grip on my collar. Expecting a reaction out of me, he continued to hold onto my shirt while notifying me that he would arrest me if I did not comply with his unlawful detainment, search, & seizure of myself & my belongings. The officer then asked me for my last name, which I provided, & when I in return asked him once more for the law or penal code I had broken to justify his detainment of me, he wouldn't respond. He then notified me that, he would instead arrest me for disorderly conduct, despite the fact that I was 100% oriented, walking away from the scene before he pursued me for no justified reason, & then decided to charge me with that simply because I had inquired about the status of the illegitimate stop. Officer McCarthy then decided to slam me against the hood of his vehicle while him & his partner arrested me. Upon the arrest McCarthy's partner, came up to me & said & I quote, "We can't have you out here stepping on our backs", which makes no sense seeing as though I was just lawfully passing by, & when detained simply asked for them to cite a lawful penal code or crime I committed that justified their detainment & arrest. This detainment & arrest was simply a power move, it was the officers displaying that they could do what they wanted & know that they would face no consequences whatsoever. Not only was I unlawfully detained, searched, & had my property seized, one of the two videos I have of the incident were deleted off of my phone. I have multiple witness to the incident that occurred, & I have a multitude of camera footage clearly displaying the officers excessive need to escalate the situation from a conversation to a violent & physical l

8/4/2019 Car Accident, We had a car accident early this morning around 2 am. We are coming from Encore Boston and on the road when suddenly a car swerve and hit our car side mirror. Our driver's seat window was open and the side mirror hit into my friend(Arianne Alcala: Driver) jaw. I was on the front passenger side. I called 911 and EMT and fire department came. We were ushered to the ambulance to be evaluated: Arriane, Me and Dorothy. We were told by EMT that Boston District 1 will be the one towing my car. I called around 4 am to see where my car is so i can inform my insurance. The officer who answered the phone was so rude, i didnt get the name coz he hung up on me, i was reffered to call Boston Everrett since the Everrett police station responded to that area. I called Everett Police and they dnt have any record of an accident. I called 911 and was referred to State Police. I was pass on to different police station from 4 am to 9 am called 911 again and was reffered to Boston Police charlestown. I spoke to the P.O. in Boston Police Charlestown and was told that my car was left from 2 am on the middle of the road from the accident site. My complains was why the Police did not show up on the accident site, and i was pass on to different police station including 911 from 2 am to 8:30 am. They never offered to go to the incident site to investigate. They only went to tow my car around 9:20 am after i told them if they want me to get out of the hospital to look for my car.

We went to Boston Police District A1 and spoke with Garney to inquire on what to do and ask a police report and pick up the yellow form: City Side. I ask him why my car was left on the streets, he just mentioned somebody just drop the ball. I ask him if i can file a complaint for the car who hit us coz it's a hit and run. Garney told us just call the Insurance since it's only a side mirror. They are not very helpful at all. We want to file a complain of the person who hit us since he run away from the accient scene. I hope to hear from you.

7/23/2019 On July 23, 2019, Officer Steven Lizardo accepted a detail at 11:11 hours from paid detail clerk Officer Gail DeCosta. The detail assignment was for contractor Phoenix Communica ons and was to be performed at 239 Sumner Street on District A‐7. The tracking number is 2139391.

Officer Lizardo's detail card was submitted with a 11:00 hours start, (11) eleven minutes prior to receiving the detail. Officer Lizardo's detail card also reflects a 11:30 hours finish me and the detail card is mark "No Show."

The scheduled start me for the detail was 8:30 hours to be completed at 16:00 hours. The detail also requested 2 (two) Officers.

The first officer assigned to this detail was Officer Kevin F. Golden. Officer Golden submitted a detail card with a 09:15 hours start time with an end me of 11:00 hours. Officer Golden received the detail from detail clerk Gail DeCosta at 09:04 hours.

I Superintendent Marcus C. Eddings contacted Phoenix Communications to inquire about the "No Show" detail on August 1, 2019 and received a reply on August 7, 2019 from Karen Manring. The reply is attached to this complaint. In short it states, the detail ended early as a result of heavy rain and Officer Lizardo contacted Phoenix Communica ons a er the job had been completed for the day and they were "halfway" back to their office.

Officer Lizardo submitted a detail card with a start time that was prior to him actually receiving the detail and he submitted a detail card marked "No Show" a er he had found out the detail was completed for the day due to heavy rain.

Officer Lizardo knowingly submitted a false detail card for compensation after he contacted Phoenix Communications to ascertain their status and was told the job had been completed for the day as a result of heavy rain.

Officer Lizardo was knowingly untruthful when he documented on his detail card 'No Show" for Phoenix Communications after learning that Phoenix Communications was in fact at the location but left as a result of heavy rain.

8/9/2019 On Saturday, 08/10/19, Mrs. Lynne Todd came in E‐5 to report harassment by her neighbor, P.O. Vincent Cullen (ID#50499). Myself, Sgt. Cottone along with Sgt. Deluca, interviewed the complainant.

Mrs. Todd stated that about 2 weeks ago (July 27th) Officer Cullen began work in his yard with a contractor excavating tree stumps and other areas of his yard. Mrs. Todd stated that P.O. Cullen didn't have a permit, but she didn't say anything to him.

Shortly thereafter the contractor, who had Mrs. Todds phone number, called Mrs. Todd and told her she should grade her yard and move her trees, the area between her yard and Officer Cullens yard. She declined.

On 08/01/19 PO Cullen texted Mrs Todd asking to speak. Mrs. Todd called him and PO Cullen said she should grade her yard and move her trees or her trees would die as a result. Again she declined. Officer Cullen then said that "She had two options. Grade the yard and move the trees or he would proceed with his work and kill the trees". Mrs. Todd declined, PO Cullen asked whether she would agree if he paid for the work. Mrs. Toss again declined. Mrs. Todd said she felt threatened by this exchange and threat to kill her trees.

Mrs. Todd stated that on Saturday, 08/03/19, PO Cullen had contractors performing work without a permit. ISD was contacted and the job was shut down. The workers returned shortly thereafter. Mrs. Todd re‐contacted ISD and contacted E5 police. At this point Mrs. Todd received a phone call from the contractor who asked Mrs. Todd, "Why she was calling the police?" Mrs. Todd doesn't know how the contractor was aware she called E911 as the officers had not arrived yet.

On Sunday 08/04/19 P.O. Cullen returned home from being away and took his snow blower out and placed it next to Mrs. Todds home. He ran the snow blower from 07:30pm un l 08:59pm.

Mrs. Todd stated that PO Cullen placed a security camera in his side window either last night or this morning. The camera is facing toward Mrs. Todds living room window and porch area. She stated she has two daughters and is concerned that PO Cullen is continuing to harass and intimidate her and her family. She stated she is very afraid that he is mentally unstable and she fears he will shoot her or her family. She stated she stopped running her air conditioners and keeps all bedroom doors open so she can hear any noises due to this situation.

8/2/2019 On Friday evening, August 2, 2019, I was assaulted and battered by Boston P.O. bearing the badge number "3598." At the time of this attack she was accompanied by Boston P.O. bearing the badge number "2029."

(For purposes of identification, I will note here that the first officer appeared to a diminutive woman of Latinx ethnicity and the second appeared to be a diminu ve man of Asian descent.)

It is my understanding that both of these officers were accompanying Boston EMS in responding to a 911 Emergency Services call for an injured person in my home at 268 Humboldt Ave, Dorchester.

When the officers and EMS workers arrived at or about 10:41 PM (according to various digital media taken from that night), I opened my rear door to allow entry of two EMS workers. Momentarily, after the EMS workers entered, the above‐mentioned Boston P.O.s appeared on my side porch. They approached the door as if to enter my home. I did not consent to these officers entering my home and there was no warrant, no probable cause, no exigent circumstances, and no circumstances allowing for the so‐called community caretaker exception. (see United States Supreme Court Cady v.

Dombrowski, 1973)

When the Boston P.O. bearing the badge number "3598" stepped into the doorway, I said something like "No, you cannot enter." She responded, "Oh, No!" and raised bother her hands to my chest‐level and struck me in my chest. I was shocked at this since there was nothing that allowed for police use of force in this situation. There is nothing in the Boston Police rules and regulations that would allow for it , nothing in the 4th Amendment to the US

Constitution, and nothing in the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. This was a violation of my federal constitutional rights, state constitutional rights, and a viola on of state criminal law. (See Massachuse s General Laws, Chapter 265, sec on 13A, Assault and Ba ery).

Out of fear and shock I stumbled backwards into my dining room, both of the officers hurried past me. This non warranted and non‐consensual entry into my house is a further violation of my state and federal rights and a violation of Boston Police regulations. See Boston Police Rules and Procedures Rule 304, Rule 113, and Rule 112)

This assault also impeded my giving assistance to the Boston EMS workers that seemed to be getting lost in my home. The EMS went to the 3rd floor to render aid.

Some me later, I would es mate about 20 or so minutes, EMS workers asked for direc on on exi ng the house in the easiest manner. I assisted.

At or about this me the officers exited the home.

In summation, I am filing this complaint in relation to both the above mentioned officers. Their actions were: assaultive, violation of the 4th Amendment, violation of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, the actions were threatening, the entry into the house was illegal and in violation of US and Mass Constitutions (See US Constitution, Fourth Amendment and Massachusetts Constitution, Article XIV), their actions were discourteous, their actions amounted to disorderly conduct (see Mass General Laws Chapter 272, Section 53), their actions amounted to trespassing (see Mass l

8/2/2019 On Friday evening, August 2, 2019, I was assaulted and battered by Boston P.O. bearing the badge number "3598." At the time of this attack she was accompanied by Boston P.O. bearing the badge number "2029."

(For purposes of identification, I will note here that the first officer appeared to a diminutive woman of Latinx ethnicity and the second appeared to be a diminu ve man of Asian descent.)

It is my understanding that both of these officers were accompanying Boston EMS in responding to a 911 Emergency Services call for an injured person in my home at 268 Humboldt Ave, Dorchester.

When the officers and EMS workers arrived at or about 10:41 PM (according to various digital media taken from that night), I opened my rear door to allow entry of two EMS workers. Momentarily, after the EMS workers entered, the above‐mentioned Boston P.O.s appeared on my side porch. They approached the door as if to enter my home. I did not consent to these officers entering my home and there was no warrant, no probable cause, no exigent circumstances, and no circumstances allowing for the so‐called community caretaker exception. (see United States Supreme Court Cady v.

Dombrowski, 1973)

When the Boston P.O. bearing the badge number "3598" stepped into the doorway, I said something like "No, you cannot enter." She responded, "Oh, No!" and raised bother her hands to my chest‐level and struck me in my chest. I was shocked at this since there was nothing that allowed for police use of force in this situation. There is nothing in the Boston Police rules and regulations that would allow for it , nothing in the 4th Amendment to the US

Constitution, and nothing in the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. This was a violation of my federal constitutional rights, state constitutional rights, and a viola on of state criminal law. (See Massachuse s General Laws, Chapter 265, sec on 13A, Assault and Ba ery).

8/9/2019 Tyrone Wynn called IAD and stated that on 8‐9‐19 about 1320 hrs, as he was driving on on Callender St he was pulled over by officers in an unmarked black suv. He stated that three plainclothes officers of Latino descent approached his vehicle. He was told that the reason for the stop was an expired inspection sticker. He provided the officers with paperwork that showed that he was still within the 7 day period for getting a newly purchased vehicle inspected.

Mr. Wynn stated that the officers arrested his passenger on an outstanding warrant. The officers asked him where he was going, where did he live (he had already given them his license), where was he coming from. He told the officers that he reused to answer their questions. When an officer ordered him to put his phone down he refused.

He was ordered out of the vehicle. The officers said that he made them nervous. He was frisked and his vehicle searched. He believes that the officer's actions were not justified for a mere traffic stop

8/17/2019 Muzac Complaint ‐ On Saturday August 17 2019 at approximately 3:33pm. As I Garry Muzac was reading from the bible for our religious demonstration.

I witnessed two Officers Megovern (badge number 1951) and officer Green badge number (5201) approach our camp speaking in an aggressive and argumentative manor. They requested to speak to Priest John Jimenez. The priest was clearly explaining something to Officer Megovern in a calm demeanor, while Officer Megovern looked to be upset and angry in an aggressive manor. As I continued to read from the bible. I noticed Sgt. Hanson (badge number 326) aggressively approach our camp equipment and demanded "we shut it down". Then I overheardhim say "I'm going to give you the opportunity to do this peacefully". At this point we felt threaten and concern with the Officers behavior. We were effectively forced to conclude our camp speaking due to police interference. This was an infringement of my civil rights and our rights wereviolated.

Butler Complaint ‐ On Aug 17, 2019 at approximately 1533 hrs two officers later identified as officer McGovern (1951) and officer Green (5201) approached our religious demonstration stating there were complaints of hate speech and sound polution. Officer McGovern demanded we turn off our sound. It was explained to officer McGovern that prior our weekly religious demonstration that expresses our religious beliefs, steps were taken to ensure it was conducted safely and lawfully. Officer McGovern stated with a lack of professionalism "We can talk back and forth all day, but we are gonna shut you down." In a aggressive manner. At this point Officer Patterson arrives and deescalates the aggression of the aggressor by pulling the aggressor officer McGovern to the side and spoke briefly and privately. Officer Patterson returned and stated that he had overheard the conversation between officer McGovern and Mr. Jimenez and didnt see anything wrong with our religious demonstration and that he didn't hear any hate speech and that it is ok to continue with our religious demonstration. We did just that and continued while officer McGovern and officer Green stood by.

Approximately 10 min later officer Lapels (3473) and officer Brooks (3080) arrived on scene. They observed the demonstration and officer Lapels approached Mr.Jimenez and asked if we had a permit. Mr Jimenez then requested to see the field supervisor. Officer Lapels responded arrogantly with

"This isn't burger king you can't just ask to speak to a manager. But a Sgt. is on his way." I then go to Officer Green and McGovern to request for name and badge numbers and they stated it has already been taken. I then go to officer Brooks for the same information and he responds sarcastically "Why do you only want the white guys badge" At approximately 1600 hrs sgt Hanson (326) charged on to the scene with a very belligerent conduct and very aggressive. He stated we can not use a mic or our equipment and that we must shut down. Mr. Jimenez responded explained that to force us to stop doing our religious demonstration is a infringement our civil rights. SGT Hanson responded that it wouldn't be a infringement of our civil rights because we need a permit. Mr Jimenez stated that he has all the documents and contacts which stated we didn't need a permit to conduct our religious demonstration. Sgt Hanson then discredited our paperwork and contacts saying they don't know what they are talking about. He then stated he will disband our religious demonstration with his officers as he headed to our equipment to do so. Then stated to Mr Jimenez in a threatening manor. "I'm gonna give you a opportunity to do this peacefully." Due to his demeanor we complied.

8/17/2019 Muzac Complaint ‐ On Saturday August 17 2019 at approximately 3:33pm. As I Garry Muzac was reading from the bible for our religious demonstration.

I witnessed two Officers Megovern (badge number 1951) and officer Green badge number (5201) approach our camp speaking in an aggressive and argumentative manor. They requested to speak to Priest John Jimenez. The priest was clearly explaining something to Officer Megovern in a calm demeanor, while Officer Megovern looked to be upset and angry in an aggressive manor. As I continued to read from the bible. I noticed Sgt. Hanson (badge number 326) aggressively approach our camp equipment and demanded "we shut it down". Then I overheardhim say "I'm going to give you the opportunity to do this peacefully". At this point we felt threaten and concern with the Officers behavior. We were effectively forced to conclude our camp speaking due to police interference. This was an infringement of my civil rights and our rights wereviolated.

Butler Complaint ‐ On Aug 17, 2019 at approximately 1533 hrs two officers later identified as officer McGovern (1951) and officer Green (5201) approached our religious demonstration stating there were complaints of hate speech and sound polution. Officer McGovern demanded we turn off our sound. It was explained to officer McGovern that prior our weekly religious demonstration that expresses our religious beliefs, steps were taken to ensure it was conducted safely and lawfully. Officer McGovern stated with a lack of professionalism "We can talk back and forth all day, but we are gonna shut you down." In a aggressive manner. At this point Officer Patterson arrives and deescalates the aggression of the aggressor by pulling the aggressor officer McGovern to the side and spoke briefly and privately. Officer Patterson returned and stated that he had overheard the conversation between officer McGovern and Mr. Jimenez and didnt see anything wrong with our religious demonstration and that he didn't hear any hate speech and that it is ok to continue with our religious demonstration. We did just that and continued while officer McGovern and officer Green stood by.

Approximately 10 min later officer Lapels (3473) and officer Brooks (3080) arrived on scene. They observed the demonstration and officer Lapels approached Mr.Jimenez and asked if we had a permit. Mr Jimenez then requested to see the field supervisor. Officer Lapels responded arrogantly with

"This isn't burger king you can't just ask to speak to a manager. But a Sgt. is on his way." I then go to Officer Green and McGovern to request for name and badge numbers and they stated it has already been taken. I then go to officer Brooks for the same information and he responds sarcastically "Why do you only want the white guys badge" At approximately 1600 hrs sgt Hanson (326) charged on to the scene with a very belligerent conduct and very aggressive. He stated we can not use a mic or our equipment and that we must shut down. Mr. Jimenez responded explained that to force us to stop doing our religious demonstration is a infringement our civil rights. SGT Hanson responded that it wouldn't be a infringement of our civil rights because we need a permit. Mr Jimenez stated that he has all the documents and contacts which stated we didn't need a permit to conduct our religious demonstration. Sgt Hanson then discredited our paperwork and contacts saying they don't know what they are talking about. He then stated he will disband our religious demonstration with his officers as he headed to our equipment to do so. Then stated to Mr Jimenez in a threatening manor. "I'm gonna give you a opportunity to do this peacefully." Due to his demeanor we complied.

came to District A‐1 to complain he was

wrongly removed from his motor vehicle by Officers Brian Garney, (Id 140298), and Officer Omar McGovern (ID 144464) during a traffic stop and his person and vehicle was searched. Mr. Alves was provided with a paper complaint form by Sgt. Brian Black who received the complaint. Sgt Black was unable at the time to access Blue Team so he documented the complaint in paper form.

He says he refused the request to exit the vehicle and told officers they had no suspicion or probable cause to remove him from the vehicle.

He stated that Officer Garney then opened door and aided by Officer McGovern physically removed him from the drivers seat. he states he was placed in handcuffs. He says he thought Officer Garney was under the influence of drugs or alcohol. He does not record any observations he made to support that assertion.

He stated he did stop the vehicle for a broken taillight. He said when he and Officer McGovern observed the driver, Benjamin Alves, he was breathing heavily consistent with a nervous person. He stated the driver had his left leg pinned against the car door and his left arm clenched tight to the area of his left leg. He stated even when the driver opened the center console with his right arm he maintained the actions of his left arm and left leg in an unnatural manner. The driver also opened and shut the center console quickly. He stated these observations were consistent with a person possibly concealing a firearm and for that reason he issued and exit order which the driver refused. he then assisted by Officer McGovern removed the driver and frisked his person and the area in lunging distance for a weapon with negative results. Officer Garney completed a Boston Police Incident report I192064835 documenting the stop, the exit order and verbal statements by the driver that he was going to tell Internal Affairs that they were intoxicated. He also said the driver said "I am a two time convicted felon and did 10 years in jail and had my name dragged through the mud' I am going to do the same now and play the game' ' I have a record now and you will too' Officer Garney said they had also completed an FIO on the incident. Sgt Black and Lt Walsh made observations of Officer Garney and found no evidence alcohol or drug use while Officer Garney made a verbal account.

This individual stated that he had called 911 to report that he had been punched in the chest outside of West End Johnnies (138 Portland St). He described the officer as not taking his incident seriously and being rude to him "getting in his face" and raising his voice, saying that he shouldn't have called the police given the neighborhood. Mr Emmons stated that he wished to start the process of a formal complaint against the officer.

The officer in question was Michael Boulger ID# 11819. I spoke with PO Boulger about the incident, and PO Boulger described the complainant as intoxicated and making unreasonable demands about apprehending his perpetrator. PO Boulger completed an incident report (I# 192066896).

8/20/2019 Tuesday, August 20, at 8:50am. ( Washington St. Downtown crossing right in front of McDonald's 329 Washington) Here is a summary of what happened. On Tuesday, August 20th, around 8:50 a.m., I was riding my skateboard in front of the McDonald's at 329

Washington St. at Downtown Crossing, on the right side of the road about one and a half feet from the curb going about 5mph on my way to work.

Suddenly, I was hit from behind by Sgt. Monteiro driving in an all black Ford Explorer, license plate 3DL971. The vehicle struck the back of my upper thighs and ran over my skateboard which made an exploding sound and shattered into two pieces. Sgt. Monteiro nearly ran over my legs which were luckily thrown out of the way as a result of him hitting me so hard. I was violently thrown down and my head was slammed excruciatingly hard off of the downtown cobblestones. I sustained injuries to my forehead, both legs, both arms, left shoulder and to my hands and I was taken by ambulance to Tufts Medical Center. I estimate that the officer was driving at least 25mph given the force with which I was hit. I have pictures of the injuries I sustained and plan on seeing doctors again since I have lost feeling on the right side of my right hand as a result of the accident. I also have the contact information for a witness who saw the entire event. There were also over 15 other witnesses that may have been interviewed by the detective who arrived on scene. Given the number of stores nearby, it is certain that a store security camera captured the incident on film, let alone the dash cam on the police car.

This incident was especially terrifying since cars do not normally travel on the downtown area of Washington St. and let alone are not supposed to be traveling at higher rates of speed. The officer must have been texting or on his laptop since I was in the road legally on the right side in plain view in front of him when he struck me with his car.

I have hospital expenses, a lost day of wages, I have lost feeling and have tingling on the right part of my right hand, and may have other long‐ term damage to my body that may manifest itself in the future. I expect significant compensa on for these damages.

6/29/2019 At around 7:30pm on the 29th of June, we were surrounded by three P.O.s at Downtown Crossing, who approached us and demanded to see photo identifi9cation. Once we provided our identification, we asked for the reason that we are being detained. WE were told that there had been an incident report and we fit the description. when we proceeded to politely ask the officers to provide their names and identification as well, we were ignored. After we insisted on getting their names and badge numbers, they finally offered it to us. Lett, (appeared to be African‐American) ‐ 2514, Lizardo, (seemed to be Latino) ‐ 1781. The female officer, (appeared to be caucasian), did not provide her information. After comparing the footage pictures of the actual suspects to our faces, Officer Lizardo realized that they had overlooked how the real suspects were dressed compared to w3hat we were wearing. The only visible relation was that they were black. As Officer Lett began to search through my friend's bag, he quickly realized that we were not the individuals involved in the reported incident. We felt disrespected. The officers were unresponsive and ignoring us for some time when we asked questions. The apology they offered appeared less than sincere and was dismissive, after the way we were treated. We continually asked for their information, for which they reluctantly responded. After publicly humiliating, concerning, and profiling us, we asked for the P.O.s name, badge number, and the police district they were attached to, the response was intimidating and aggressive. We request a review of their of their body cam, along with other available footage, and an investigation into this matter. We are also seeking an official apololgy in writing from the P.O.s involved. Their stop and search did not appear to be warranted, and it was intrusive and disrespectful. Lastly, our hope is for on going dialogue and effective training for P.O.s to best manage such situations moving forward with more cultural sensitively and care.

9/8/2019 On 9/9/2019, Mr. Dennis Hicks called IAD and stated that he was stopped on Boston St yesterday around 3:00 PM. He stated that he lives in Oregon and has a temporary license plate from the state of Oregon on his car. He stated that he refused to give the officer his license. He stated that he did not like the way the officers removed him from his vehicle and felt that they had no probable cause to search his vehicle. Mr. Hicks was not issued a citation. I viewed the body cam footage from Officer Steven O'Connell and all Officers appeared to conduct themselves in a professional manner. I explained this to complainant and he still insisted on making a complaint.

8/31/2019 The morning of the parade 2 independent journalists representing the YouTube media channel " Auditing America" arrived at the Boston Straight Pride parade to meet organizers and received their press credentials. Almost immediately Boston PD removed 1 member, Enrique Morales from the parade member area after an officer recognized him from his YouTube channel. Parade organizers attempted to inform the police that their position was that anyone with their press credentials was part of the parade yet Boston PD refused to allow Enrique Morales to exercise his first amendment right to free press. Shortly afterwards William Turbitt also an Auditing America press member was appealing to police Superintendent Rich regarding the expulsion of Enrique Morales when Officer Patty DeRosa decided to film him with her personal phone. William Turbitt immediately asked her to identify herself by name and badge number but Officer Darosa refused and walked away. William Turbitt followed Officer Darosa insisting that she identify herself.

Superintendent Rich immediately stepped in and took an aggressive stance with Mr. Turbitt while also refusing to name Officer Daraosa.

Superintendent Rich then gave orders to remove William Turbitt from the participants are of the parade even though he did nothing wrong and had valid press credentials. At the point where William Turbit was being escorted out an officer attempted to escort me and walked away after I distanced myself. As he walked away I asked him to iden fy himself and he stated he would not.

This video covers the por on of the incident I just described:

In the second video I am including we can hear an officer talking to parade Attourney Del Gallo. Mr. Del Gallo clearly states that the parade organizers position is that the members given press passes are to be in the parade. The officer then makes a statement comparing the expelled press members to people "crying fire in a crowded theatre" as reasoning for their removal. The idea that a press member asking for an officer to be held accountable somehow equates to the creation of a panic situation is ubsurd. In this video Superintendent Rich finally reveals the name of Officer Darosa and informs me that she has been relieved. He also states that she claims she was not filming at the time she held her camera forward. I don't believe this for a moment and think that this is a convenient excuse to obsolve the department of supplying us this footage thru a public records request. We ask that her phone be forensically examined to prove there was no dele on of film on that morning.

9/5/2019 After asking two people who appeared to be using drugs to leave the area next to my car where they were sitting, they refused to leave and became belligerent. I was locked out of my house and waiting for a neighbor to let me in, so the verbal altercation continued. When I approached my car again, one of the parties punched me in the side of the head. After this, I pursued them up to island street. I saw a Boston police K9 cruiser in traffic on Melnea Cass and knocked on the window. I explained to the officer that someone had just assaulted me, and his response was "good!". After pursuing the interaction with the officer, explaining that I lived in the area and was not just another transient, he finally agreed to pull around the corner. He did not pull far enough up the street to see where the person who assaulted me was, then said he "didn't see anyone". Of course by this point, the person had seen the cruiser and taken off running. To add insult to injury, I then called 911 realizing I'd get no help from this officer, and it took an hour and a half to get another officer to respond.

9/9/2019 Complainant Allison Joyce alleged that on September 9, 2019, she went to District 13 to obtain a tow release for her vehicle. Ms. Joyce alleged that Officer Milton was "rude and passive‐aggressive, making comments about me to officers in the station, visibly annoyed." After obtaining the release, at about 6:45 pm, Ms. Joyce went to Metro Tow and found that it was closed. She called the number, spoke with an unidentified man, and was met with a profanity‐laced tirade including, "I am sick of your shit bitch!", "You a nasty fucking bitch, fuck you!", and "Your mama is a nasty fucking cunt, you fucking nasty bitch!" Ms. Joyce hung up. At 6:56 pm, Ms. Joyce received a call from the same man (now calling from whos stated, "This

call is being recorded and you can pick up your car tomorrow at 9:00 am."

Ms. Joyce called District 13 to inform them of the nature of her interaction with this man from Metro Tow and of her discomfort and concern about going back to that location. After several minutes on hold, Ms. Joyce spoke with Officer Milton and communicated her concerns. Ms. Joyce alleged that Officer Milton was adversarial and seemed resistant to listen to her concerns. Officer Milton stated to Ms. Joyce that the man at Metro Tow had a different account of what had happened. When Ms. Joyce questioned her as to how or why she said this, Officer Milton advised her that she had called the man at Metro Tow.

Ms. Joyce believed that Officer Milton compromised her safety by contacting Metro Tow before she spoke with her. Ms. Joyce asked to speak with a supervisor and was transferred to Lt. Creaven. Ms. Joyce alleged that her discussion with Lt. Creaven was "circular and unhelpful."

At 9:42 pm, Ms. Joyce received another call from the man at Metro Tow who stated, "This call is being recorded, you coming to the lot? You called Boston Police? We waiting for you, you coming to the lot?" The man also called Ms. Joyce a "nasty bitch" again. Ms. Joyce hung up, called District 13, and asked to speak with Lt. Creaven. Ms. Joyce informed Lt. Creaven about the unsolicited, threatening call to which Lt. Creaven responded that she thought he was just asking if she wanted to pick up her car. Ms. Joyce alleged that Lt. Creaven told her she did not believe the language used was threatening and she should just go pick up her car that night. Ms. Joyce ended the call, only to call back about 1 minute later because she felt uneasy about going to the tow lot after 10:00 pm. Ms. Joyce alleged that she was told by someone she believes is a cadet that Lt. Creaven was not available.

I told him I was sick too but that was no reason to speak to me like that. I was frazzled at the fact he was speaking to me in the manner he was so I only got down his license plate and name and we both went on our way. He should not be speaking to people that way it is very intimidating especially when I was not in the wrong. He also shouldn't be driving if he is as drowsy as he was.

He should not be speaking to people that way it is very intimidating especially when I was not in the wrong. He also shouldn't be driving if he is as drowsy as he was.

9/26/2019 I witnessed a collision between a cyclist and automobile on the pedestrian crossing at the intersection of Prentiss St and the SW Corridor. I immediately ran to assist the cyclist, and so was next to him when a P.O. arrived, approximately 1‐2 minutes following the collision. The P.O. immediately told the cyclist ‐ who was still disoriented and in shock ‐ that the collision was his fault for "not stopping." When I objected, the P.O. told me to move away, and that I had not witnessed the collision, even though I had told him that I did witness it. When I asked for the officer's badge number, because of concerns about his handling of the vic m and witnesses, he pulled his jacket over his badge so it was not visible and told me "You don't need that."

It is inappropriate for an officer to tell the victim of a life‐threatening collision that it is their fault, particularly in the immediate aftermath of the collision, when they are vulnerable and likely confused. The officer was dismissive and combative with an immediate witness to the incident, who sought to assist the vic m. And it is profoundly unse ling for a city employee to ac vely conceal their iden ty when asked to share it.

I would ask that the officer in question be counseled on the above matters, and that BPD undertake broader education about the management of vic ms in the immediate a ermath of life‐threatening collisions.

8/31/2019 The incident of note occurred August 31, 2019 in Boston, MA. The agency involved was the Boston Police Dept.

I am 64 years of age, and currently live in the North‐East Kingdom (NEK) of Vermont. I require the use of one or two "Canadian Cane" style crutches for mobility due to neurological damage I received roughly 23 years ago. I also have damage to multiple discs in my neck and back, as confirmed by recent MRIs.

I was a participant in the counter‐protest at the Government Center on August 31. I was using a single crutch for mobility because I was carrying a

"street‐medic" bag. When the BPD Bicycle Unit attacked protesters, I was one of the people knocked down. In falling, I lost my grip on my crutch. BPD

arrested anyone that fell. An officer, believed to be Capt Danilecki of the Bicycle Unit, then sprayed a large amount of pepper‐spray or mace into my eyes. During my arrest, a bearded officer took my crutch and carried it away, despite my repeated insistence that I am disabled and need the crutch to move. Another officer took my medic‐bag that had my cellphone inside. None of these items were booked with me at A1 Precinct.

On Sept. 3, 2019, I returned to Boston for court, where all legal charges against me were dropped. I went over to the A1 Precinct, where I was booked, and filed a request for information regarding the disposition of my missing items.To date, my Canadian Cane has not been returned, nor has the BPD

responded in any way. The medic‐bag and cellphone are also still missing. Several videos from the protest are available; that show me treating myself for pepper‐spray; that show the bearded officer walking away with my crutch; and that show another officer picking up my medic‐bag. So there is video evidence available showing that all my items, especially the crutch, were in BPD control. There all also videos documenting an officer half-dragging me away and it is obvious just how much pain I was in. I repeatedly no fied officers of my disabili es but they were completely ignored.

I wish to file and proceed with an ADA complaint against the Boston Police Department and the City of Boston.

9/29/2019 On Tuesday October 1, 2019, I received a telephone complaint regarding an unknown officer who was conducting traffic control at the intersection of Cambridge St and Harvard Ave on Sunday September 29th at approximately 7:30 pm. The reporting party, Ms. Pat Curran, stated she was trying to drive down Harvard Ave with her daughter, however the road was blocked with police barricades and P.O.s. She stated that upon observing the road was blocked she drove around to the other side of Harvard Ave on the Brighton Ave side and that side of Harvard Ave was blocked as well. She then returned to the Cambridge St side of Harvard Ave and asked the male officer who was near Cambridge St that she described as, "older white male in his 40's", if she could drive down to Harvard Terrace.

According to Curran, he was described as, "Rude and belligerent," and told her that the road was closed and would be open at approximately 8:00 pm and she could not drive through due to the ongoing Harvard Ave street fair. It should be noted that on Sunday September 29th, there was an all day street fair with hundreds of attendees and vendors in the Harvard Ave roadway and at the time of the alleged complaint, the vendors were in the process of packing up their equipment and people were s ll in the roadway.

After hearing Curran's description of the complaint, I advised her that I would need to attempt to determine who the officers were and I would call her back. After viewing the list of two officers assigned to the Harvard Ave street fair, I spoke with both officers by telephone about their activities at the Harvard Ave street fair. Officer James O'Connor did not recall any conversations with a person attempting to navigate down Harvard Ave. Officer Robert Butler did recall a conversation with a woman who was attempting to enter Harvard Ave during the street fair. Officer Butler stated that he told her the roadway was closed until about 8:00 pm and she could not enter because it was too dangerous with all the people and equipment still in the road.

I left two voice mail messages for Curran to contact me and was able to speak with her on Monday October 7, 2019. I advised her I spoke with the officer who may have been involved and he was counseled on his treatment of the public. However, she wanted to ensure that her complaint was in writing.

She said she did not see it and there was no sign, there were just two ridiculous orange cones in the middle of the road with no directions. She apologized and he screamed

"everyone's sorry today." Which leads me to presume my mom was not the only one who had trouble deciphering the lack of construction signs on the road this afternoon.

When the police arrived in the wagon driven by Manning he stopped in the middle of the street and acted as if he didnt want to get out & address the situtation because I was black and the other party was white without and concrete information he starts telling me there right. He didnt see any paperwork nor had he gone in the basement to see the hea ng system.

It was not until I asked for him to call a Sgt. he parked the vehicle and got out. Then he began to act hostile with me and all I wanted to do was insure my children and I were safe because I had no no fica on about this work.

Officer Manning began to be combative with me and the only reason he in my opinion was agreeing with the other side was because they looked like him.

As a result of Officer Manning discriminating against me and not thoroughly do his job the people pulled all wires out of the heating system and there is no heat in my apartment.

I called the police because I arrived home from school and saw people who failed to identify themselves pulling the heating system out of the basement. When I asked for a copy of the permit they failed to provide it to me which at that point I felt it was be er for the police to intervene.

When the police arrived in the wagon driven by Manning he stopped in the middle of the street and acted as if he didnt want to get out & address the situtation because I was black and the other party was white without and concrete information he starts telling me there right. He didnt see any paperwork nor had he gone in the basement to see the hea ng system.

It was not until I asked for him to call a Sgt. he parked the vehicle and got out. Then he began to act hostile with me and all I wanted to do was insure my children and I were safe because I had no no fica on about this work.

Officer Manning began to be combative with me and the only reason he in my opinion was agreeing with the other side was because they looked like him.

As a result of Officer Manning discriminating against me and not thoroughly do his job the people pulled all wires out of the heating system and there is no heat in my apartment.

9/24/2019 This complaint is regarding the two P.O.s that were stationed at the Boston polling location at Woodbourne Apartments (6 Southbourne Road, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130) during the last election on the morning of Tuesday, September 24, 2019 (approx. 6am‐1pm). I was serving as a poll worker for precinct 19‐12. Precinct 19‐7 was also present at the polling location. I was extremely disappointed to see the behavior of the two police offers working at the polling location in the morning. The officers were supposed to be checking residents out, but they were completely inattentive and seemingly had no interest in doing the job. One of the offers was watching a movie on his phone for the entire morning. He had earphones in and had no awareness of residents coming up to the desk to be checked out. He didn't bother to remove the earphones and hardly even looked up when residents approached the desk. The other officer was talking on the phone (on personal calls) for half the morning. When residents approached the desk to be checked out, they were confused as to whether he was talking to them or not. He didn't bother to put the phone calls on hold when people needed help. In my opinion, the unprofessional behavior of both officers was completely unacceptable and may have affected the accuracy of the check‐out logs. I sincerely hope that I don't see the same behavior during the next election on November 5. Unfortunately, I do not know the names of the officers or the badge numbers, but they said they were from District A‐1.

10/13/2019 A neighbor residing at #46 McBride Street assaulted me by shooting me in the face, eyes, and chest with a water hose on full blast after a racist tirade while standing on the sidewalk over a parking spot. I dialed 911 reques ng police assistance and briefed them on what happened.

Both officers arrived 5‐10 minutes after the initial call. Officer Dell spoke with me and McMaster spoke to the neighbor. I informed Dell that I intended to press full charges. He said he didn't see it so he could not make an arrest. I pointed to my swollen eye, wet clothes, and water spray on my car outlining where I'd been standing. He asked if I needed medical a en on for my eye. I said yes, and he radioed the EMT rolling his eyes at the no on.

I asked about the arrest again insisted there was nothing they could do, but said they called their supervisor and he would make the final decision to arrest or not.

The supervisor arrived and talked to the woman for a minute when he was finished I walked over toward him. He said that it was his opinion that this was just a neighborly dispute, and no arrest would be made. I explained to the officer neighborly disputes do not turn physical. He said at best it was a simple assault, and that while there were witnesses the police themselves did personally see the attack. He never bothered to ask me any questions.

Once the police made it clear they were more interested in legally representing the perpetrator who had assaulted me, than doing their job I left in the ambulance to the hospital where I was treated for a black eye and whiplash.

I called the police because it was the right thing to do, but when they arrived I felt less safe due to their bias, lack of professionalism and refusal to do their job. I would like the officers handling the call to be inves gated and my assailant to be arrested.

3/31/2019 On 15 August, 2019, Capt. McCormick was advised that Officer Edward Grace, ID #140299, was flagged by Auditing and Review for possibly violating Rule 325.9 as he had accepted a detail ofor a date and time at which he had court. I, Capt. Kelley McCormick, was requested to investigate such and have determined that Officer Grace did in fact accept a detail and went to the detail, when he realized that he had a court slip for that same time. He states he attended court and then returned to his detail. The rule states that anyone who accepts a detail for a date in which the officer is scheduled for court shall be in violation of the Rule. The Rule allows an officer to accept a detail only AFTER complting his/her court servie. This is a strict liability Rule, and no intent is required. As such, Officer Grace violated Rule 325.9, and has received an Oral Reprimand (recorded such in his district file).

On November 6, 2019, I spoke with Security Manager Mr. Casimir Deronette. Per Mr. Deronette, the Boston Symphony Orchestra did not have any events scheduled for October 8, 2019.

Mr. Deronette stated that it is a practice of the Boston Symphony Orchestra to request details 15‐30 days in advance via email. The email is sent to Detail Clerks Officer David Hansford, Officer Brian Lydon, and Officer Brian Doherty. An email is also sent to Captain Steven Sweeney. The email indicates the dates and mes the Boston Symphony Orchestra is reques ng a detail.

A copy of the schedule request for details with a date range from October 1, 2019 through November 1, 2019 is a ached to this complaint.

Mr. Deronette was asked why Ms. Marjorie Vidal signed a detail card for an unscheduled event at the Boston Symphony Orchestra. Mr. Deronette stated that he did not believe that Ms. Vidal would sign a detail card for an unscheduled event.

I stated to Mr. Deronette that I would email him a copy of the detail card for verification of the signature. After emailing a copy of the detail card, Mr.

10/20/2019 I got into a car accident and when the P.O. came over he didn't ask if we were okay or needed an ambulance. He also didn't give me a second to breathe before telling him how the accident happened. This P.O. also wrote on the police report for the incident that it was raining when it was clear outside. Also, when he came up to me he started talking to me like the accident was already my fault. He didn't communicate what was going on at all with my car. I asked him if AAA could tow my car since I had it (which he didn't ask me if I did in the first place) and then he was getting aggressive with his tone with me when I was trying to insist they come. I tried to explain to him that I can't pay for just any tow truck company to take my car because I don't have the money and he said "that's not my problem". He yelled at me that my car was in the middle of the road (which it was not, it was off on the side of the road) and that's why I had no choice in how it was removed.

As a former RMV employee I know this will still go on my driving record, despite being a warning, and find it absurd that to dispute this I have to spend $25 of my own money when I am a taxpayer who has done nothing wrong.

12/3/2019 Was pulled over just after the light at Lagrange and Centre in front of the Corrib, abruP.O.y with lights flashing and sirens tight on my car. Officer came out and yelled at me to move my car. When I asked what I did, he responded that I knew. After he approached my car, he told me my registration was expired. I stated it was not, that it had been renewed over a week ago. He then demanded my license and told me to get my old registration, if I even had it. I produced what was requested. He then went to his patrol car for approximately 5 minutes and returned and told me that my registration was actually active, which I told him I had already told him that, he responded by saying it was against the law not to have the sticker. I had the RMV email pulled up on my phone, which he then saw and said that I had to have that or it wasn't valid. He had already written the warning without ever indicating or even giving the time to say anything about the paper. The entire exchange was rude, disrespectful, abrupt, and quite frankly the officer treated me like I had committed a heinous crime, rather than just be missing a sticker. I support the police, but being treated like a criminal for a missing sticker is unacceptable.

Mr. Reid‐Morrison stated that he was approached by three P.O.s when he exited the Mazda, Mr. Eddins was still seated in the motor vehicle. The P.O.s told him he looked suspicious and that he looked like he was urinating on the sidewalk. Mr. Reid‐Morrison denies urinating. Mr. Reid‐Morrison admits that he and Mr. Eddins were at Club Saavor earlier in the night and had been drinking. Mr. Reid‐Morrison stated that he remembers being on the ground handcuffed being kicked in the face. Mr. Reid‐Morrison stated that he doesn't remember what happened from the initial encounter with the police to being on the ground handcuffed. When asked Mr. Reid‐Morrison admits that he may of gotten mouthy with the officers because he didn't like being stopped or his motor vehicle being searched. Mr. Reid‐Morrison stated that police didn't find anything in his motor vehicle, but threatened to arrest him. Mr. Reid‐Morrison stated he asked the police why they beat him up, and the police told him he scratched himself on the ground. Mr. Reid‐ Morrison stated he was bleeding from the nose, un‐handcuffed and released. Mr. Reid‐Morrison stated that the police took his identification but is un‐aware if the police wrote down his information. Mr. Reid‐Morrison stated that he asked for the officers names and he was denied that informa on.

Mr. Reid‐Morrison describes the officers as‐ three white males, plain clothes, one of the officers had facial hair and was wearing a red hoodie. No facial hair on the other two officers. All appeared to be in their early thirties. When asked Mr. Reid‐Morrison stated that the officers said they were police but he didn't see any badges or firearms with them. He has no idea what kind of vehicle they were opera ng.

Mr. Reid‐Morrison stated that another officer arrived when he was in handcuffs. He describes this officer as a white male, in his thirties, and in a Boston Police uniform. Mr. Reid‐Morrison stated that this officer was not involved just there.

I asked Mr. Reid‐Morrison if there was anything else he wanted to add or is there something I'm not asking him and he stated no.

I observed Mr. Reid‐Morrison to be holding an ice pack to the right side of his face which appeared to be swollen, he had a swollen lip with discoloration on the inside, and he complains of pain to the right rear of his head, and a swollen nose. I asked Mr. Reid‐Morrison if he wanted medical a en on and he declined.
